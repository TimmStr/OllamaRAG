# OllamaRAG# üß† AI Knowledge Platform ‚Äì Modular RAG System with TimescaleDB, LLM, and Automation

This project is a modular AI-powered platform that integrates data collection, semantic search (RAG), automated
reporting, and high-performance storage ‚Äî all orchestrated via Docker Compose.

It is built around four core microservices, a full observability stack, and a conversational UI for interacting with the
system.

## üß© Services Overview

### 1. **collector_service**

üîé *"Curate the knowledge."*  
Retrieves the 100 most influential AI papers, preprocesses them for downstream analysis, and feeds them into a RAG
pipeline. This service continuously collects new data to keep your system current.

### 2. **reporting_service** 

üßæ *"Turn data into action."*  
Generates automated reports and insights using LLMs. Supports email generation and dispatch for alerting, summaries, or
analytics delivery.

### 3. **db_service**

üóÑÔ∏è *"Centralized, high-performance data storage."*  
Manages all data via a TimescaleDB instance, optimized for both structured and time-series workloads. Acts as the
backend for all other services.

### 4. **llm_service**

ü§ñ *"Conversational AI meets structured data."*  
A multi-purpose LLM interface that:

- Powers semantic search and retrieval through FAISS indices (RAG)
- Answers questions based on documents, files, or embedded content
- Analyzes `.csv` and `.xlsx` files using natural language
- Composes and sends professional emails

---

## üõ† Infrastructure Stack

- **TimescaleDB** ‚Äì High-performance time-series DB
- **Grafana** ‚Äì Monitoring and dashboarding
- **EFK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana) ‚Äì Logging and observability
- **OpenWebUI** ‚Äì Frontend interface for LLM interaction
- **Ollama** ‚Äì Local LLM model provider
- **Docker Compose** ‚Äì All services and components are containerized and orchestrated together

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose installed
- ~16GB+ RAM recommended for local LLM inference (Ollama)

### Start the stack

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up -d

```

üß™ Example Use Cases

    Ask the system:
        "What are the key ideas in the most cited AI papers from last year?"

    Upload a spreadsheet and ask:
        "Which product had the highest profit margin over time?"

    Let the system send a report email automatically:
        "Weekly model drift summary and recommendations"

    Search your RAG database with natural questions like:
        "What methods does the AlphaFold paper use for protein folding?"
